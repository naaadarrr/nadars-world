## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`:

```bash
NODE_ENV=
HASHNODE_PUBLICATION_ID=
```

You'll need to set your actual Hashnode publication ID from hashnode dashboard.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the site.
